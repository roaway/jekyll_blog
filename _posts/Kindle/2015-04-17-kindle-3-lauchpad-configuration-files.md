自从有了平板，Chromebook, 我的Kindle 3的使用机会是越来越少了。之前在Kindle 3上捣鼓的一些配置，尤其是一些特别实用的快捷键都忘记了。下面就贴出lauchpad的快捷键配置。

** fbreader.ini

# start kindlepdfviewer without framework in /mnt/us/documents

# start kindlepdfviewer without framework on last read document
P L = !/mnt/us/kindlepdfviewer/kpdf.sh --framework_stop
# restart amazon framework - when it got irritated
P R = !/etc/init.d/framework restart

# launchpad.ini
;;;
;;; when started, the kindle launchpad just transparently scans keypad and
;;; fiveway keystrokes until the user presses and releases the hot sequence
;;; Introducer key. Then the launchpad enters the hotkey mode: it captures
;;; all system input, engages the interval timer to trigger after specified
;;; HotInterval milliseconds and starts collecting further keystrokes in an internal
;;; hotkey sequence buffer.
;;; When the hotkey interval timer triggers or the Trailer key is pressed, the system
;;; input capture gets released, and an attempt to execute collected hotkey action
;;; is made. Available hotkey actions are controlled by contents of the [Action]
;;; section below

; Kindle input key symbolic names are used to specify the hotkey sequence introducer
; and trailer keys. See keydefs.ini for details
[Settings]
Introducer = Shift
Trailer = Enter
HotInterval = 700
ScriptDirectory = ./scripts
KeyboardInput = /dev/input/event0
FivewayInput = /dev/input/event1
InterKeyDelay = 300

;;; hotkey actions are defined below as <key_sequence> = <action_command>
;;; one action definition per text line.
;;;
;;; <key_sequence> is a blank separated list of key symbolic names. See keydefs.ini for details.
;;; <action_command> describes the action to execute on a particular hotkey sequence.
;;; Currently three type of action supported depending on the first character of the
;;; command string:
;;;  '!' -- shell command. The <action_command> string excluding the leading '!' is sent to the
;;;         system shell, exactly as it was typed from the console.
;;;  '@' -- Kindle Framework script. The <action_command> string excluding the leading '@' is interpreted
;;;         as a name of a special script containing command information obeying format of
;;;         the known hotkeys package. The main purpose of these scripts is to simplify
;;;         entering special symbols into kindle Framework search box
;;;  '#' -- Kindle Framework key sequence. Similar to the above, but doesn't require
;;;         external script.
;;;   all other command strings are interpreted as a sequence of a send_key commands. The contents of these
;;;   commands gets interpreted and sent as a sequence of simulated keystrokes to the input subsystem.
;;;   Such commands consist of the space-separated tokens, which can be symbolic key names and/or
;;;   ascii strings enclosed in quotes (")
;;;
;;;   Note: to correctly accept  kindle key sequence starting with a special
;;;         symbol, the Framework search box should be brought up, if not already.
;;;         Press the 'Del' key on Kindle in order to bring the search box up
;;;
